# kr00k

This is my take on kr00k. 
As a college pupil, I have to do a project concerning "Social stakes". 
I chose to speak about wifi security, and more precisly about the kr00k exploit. 
So this my take on kr00k, kind of. 

# Better kr00ks 
There already exist way better tool than this one (I totally did not inspire me from those projects) :
https://github.com/hexway/r00kie-kr00kie
https://github.com/akabe1/kr00ker/blob/master/kr00ker.py

# usage 
For the exploit file : It is all written in the python files, just call --help and you'll be good 
You need to put your wifi card in monitor mode first tho

For the traffic one : you should be able to launch it without any parameter. Launch it on the target machine. 
I noted that a ping request works, and you do not flood your ap, maybe go for a ping instead
