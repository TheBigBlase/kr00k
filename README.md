# kr00k

This is my take on kr00k. 
As a college pupil, I have to do a project concerning "Social stakes". 
I chose to speak about wifi security, and more precisly about the kr00k exploit. 
So this my take on kr00k, kind of. 
Since i wrote this as a graduation project, I am not be responsible for your actions. This tool is and shall remain an edutational tool. Use it on your own material. 

# Better kr00ks 
There already exist way better tool than this one (I totally did not inspire myself from those projects) :
https://github.com/hexway/r00kie-kr00kie
https://github.com/akabe1/kr00ker/blob/master/kr00ker.py

# usage 
For the exploit file : instruction are all written inside the python files, just call --help and you'll be good 
You need to put your wifi card in monitor mode first tho. If you do not know how to proceed, go check the airmon-ng manual
To grab the AP and target mac addresses, you shall use airodump-ng

For the traffic one : it does not take any arguments. Just lanch as is
I noticed that a ping request works as well, and you do not flood your ap, maybe go for a ping instead
